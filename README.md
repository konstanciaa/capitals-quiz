## User Experience Design (UXD)
+ **Strategy Plane**. A quiz for enterntainment which provides users with the opportunity to check their knowledge of capitals.
+ **Scope Plane**. The title of the quiz, instructions, input for username and the start button. After clicking "Start" button the user sees one question with three options at a time (which helps not to distract). There is "Next" button under under the option. The "Next" button submits the answer and opens the next question.
+ **Structure Plane**. The introduction window contains simple clear instructions how to start and rules how to play. 
+ **Skeleton Plane**.
